# The-Travel-Advisor -<a href="https://the-traveladvisor.netlify.app/"> DEMO </a> 

During my boot camp with HackYourFuture- Amsterdam. I was assigned to make a project for the Browser's Module using Javascript and DOM . After thinking alot about it i came up with the idea to make an app where users get useful information about countries before planning their trip . In this App the user can find most of the data that is good to know about the country. In this project i did not got the time to make it responsive but in future i have plans to make it responsive and add some more interesting features.
